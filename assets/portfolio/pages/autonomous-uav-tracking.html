        <h1 class="article-title">Autonomous UAV Tracking with Physics-Constrained Learning</h1>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            This project presents an advanced autonomous UAV tracking framework combining state-of-the-art object detection and reinforcement learning. The system enables a "chaser" UAV to follow a dynamic "target" UAV in complex environments while maintaining safety and precision. This approach addresses challenges such as high-speed trajectories, non-linear movements, and maintaining a consistent field of view (FoV) through a physics-constrained learning approach.
        </p>

        <h2 class="article-subtitle">Key Features</h2>
        <ul class="article-list">
            <li>
                <b>Perception:</b> 
                Uses a YOLOv11-based object detection model integrated with Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF) and a Kalman Filter to estimate and track the target's position in real-time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Control:</b> 
                Employs a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm with physics-informed constraints. The controller optimizes the chaser UAV’s velocities and yaw angle while maintaining tracking accuracy and safety.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Physics-Constrained Action Space:</b> 
                Integrates target dynamics to bound the chaser's actions, improving training efficiency and real-world robustness.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Simulation Environment:</b> 
                Developed using AirSim and Unreal Engine, offering high-fidelity simulation of UAV dynamics, realistic environments, and robust testing scenarios.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="article-subtitle">Methodology</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The framework follows a two-part approach to solve the coupled problems of target estimation and UAV control:
        </p>
        <ul class="article-list">
            <li>
                <b>Target Estimation:</b> 
                The YOLOv11 model identifies the target UAV and provides bounding box coordinates. These are passed through KCF for short-term tracking and Kalman filtering for smoothing and predicting the target's next position.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Control Using Physics-Constrained RL:</b> 
                The control policy, trained using PPO, computes optimal velocities (Vx, Vy, Vz) and yaw angle (θ) for the chaser UAV. Physics-informed constraints bound the action space, ensuring feasible movements and minimizing the risk of losing the target.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="article-subtitle">Simulation Framework</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The simulation was built using AirSim on Unreal Engine, enabling high-fidelity physics and realistic environments. Five pre-defined target trajectories were created, with randomized initial positions and environmental settings for each mission scenario. The chaser UAV is initialized to have a direct line of sight with the target, and the mission concludes if the target leaves the chaser’s FoV for more than 5 seconds.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The framework was implemented with a Gymnasium interface, providing seamless integration with RL libraries and enabling efficient training and evaluation.
        </p>

        <h2 class="article-subtitle">Applications</h2>
        <ul class="article-list">
            <li>Surveillance and monitoring in urban environments.</li>
            <li>Search-and-rescue missions in dynamic and cluttered settings.</li>
            <li>Wildlife tracking for conservation studies.</li>
            <li>Inspection of aerial and terrestrial infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="article-subtitle">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The proposed physics-constrained learning approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and real-world UAV tracking applications. By combining cutting-edge perception and control methodologies with robust simulations, the framework demonstrates significant improvements in tracking accuracy, training efficiency, and real-world applicability.
