        <p class="article-paragraph">
            This project used imitation learning to develop a framework that enables UAVs to navigate complex urban environments efficiently. The UAV learned to mimic expert trajectories by utilizing inverse reinforcement learning techniques, optimizing routes to avoid obstacles and minimize travel time.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The framework was designed to be adaptable to new environments by retraining on various scenarios. Applications for this project include autonomous delivery systems, urban surveillance, and emergency medical response. Testing in simulated urban settings demonstrated the UAV's ability to autonomously find safe, efficient routes without requiring prior knowledge of the environment.
