        <h1 class="article-title">Scalable and Load-Balanced Coverage Path Planning (SCoPP)</h1>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Modern challenges in large-scale area coverage demand innovative solutions, especially when deploying multi-UAV teams for applications like disaster response, environmental surveys, and urban mapping. This project presents the Scalable Coverage Path Planning (SCoPP) framework, a highly efficient and adaptable approach tailored for non-convex, large-scale environments. SCoPP not only ensures comprehensive coverage but also emphasizes equitable load balancing across UAVs, minimizing mission time and maximizing efficiency.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            The SCoPP framework operates through a meticulously designed pipeline comprising five core stages:
        </p>
        <ul class="article-list">
            <li><b>Area Selection:</b> Identifying and segmenting the target zones, including defining priorities and constraints like no-fly zones.</li>
            <li><b>Discretization:</b> Dividing the area into manageable grid cells, ensuring precise coverage calculations.</li>
            <li><b>Partitioning:</b> Assigning grid cells to individual UAVs based on workload balance and spatial proximity.</li>
            <li><b>Conflict Resolution:</b> Addressing overlaps or constraints to ensure smooth navigation and task distribution.</li>
            <li><b>Path Planning:</b> Generating optimized, collision-free routes for each UAV, tailored to their assigned regions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            SCoPP’s scalability and flexibility are its standout features. The framework seamlessly adapts to teams of up to 150 UAVs and computes high-quality plans within minutes, even in terrains with intricate boundaries or constraints. Two specialized variants enhance its functionality:
        </p>
        <ul class="article-list">
            <li><b>SCoP3:</b> Incorporates user-defined priorities, allowing UAVs to focus on high-importance regions first.</li>
            <li><b>SCoPE:</b> Optimized for time-constrained missions, prioritizing swift execution without compromising coverage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            Extensive simulations in both synthetic and real-world inspired scenarios demonstrated SCoPP’s superiority over baseline approaches, achieving up to a 30% improvement in workload balance and a 25% reduction in completion time. Field trials using physical UAVs further validated these findings, showcasing robust performance in environments with real-world uncertainties.
        </p>
        <p class="article-paragraph">
            SCoPP stands out as a cutting-edge solution bridging the gap between simulation and practical deployment. Whether managing disaster-stricken areas, tracking environmental changes, or enabling urban surveys, SCoPP redefines scalability and efficiency in multi-UAV path planning.
